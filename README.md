## CV
I have developed scripts, telegram bots, scraper for company Corpberry, that had an interesting business logic, unusual tasks. It was a good start in a Backend Developer career.
Then there were Django tasks, mostly Django templates and Django ORM, but I want to go on Django REST Framework, create modern Backend, also using the knowledge of machine learning, which I am now actively studying.
I am actively looking for a job in Serbia, in Belgorod, as I have been trying to move for several months.
I lead an active lifestyle, I love cycling and running.
I prefer companies with a friendly team and interesting tasks and opportunities for development.
